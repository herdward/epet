type object_phrase = string list
(** The type [object_phrase] represents the object phrase that can be part of a
    player command. Each element of the list represents a word of the object
    phrase, where a "word" is defined as a consecutive sequence of non-space
    characters. Thus, no element of the list should contain any leading,
    internal, or trailing spaces. The list is in the same order as the words in
    the original player command. For example:

    - If the player command is ["feed orange juice"], then the object phrase is
      [\["orange"; "juice"\]].

    - If the player command is ["feed orange    juice"], then the object phrase is
      again [\["orange"; "juice"\]]. *)

(* Note that the backslashes in the OCamldoc comment above are inserted by
   OCamlformat for sake of the HTML version of the documentation. When reading
   the source code of the comment in this file, pretend that the backslashes do
   not exist. That is, the object phrase is simply [["clock"; "tower"]]. *)

(** The type [command] represents a player command that is decomposed into a
    verb and possibly an object phrase. Invariant: the [object_phrase] carried
    by [Feed]  or [Clean] must not be empty. *)
type command =
  | Feed of object_phrase
  | Clean of object_phrase
  | Quit

exception Empty
(** Raised when an empty command is parsed. *)

exception Malformed
(** Raised when a malformed command is parsed. *)

val parse : string -> command
(** [parse str] parses a player's input into a [command], as follows. The first
    word (i.e., consecutive sequence of non-space characters) of [str] becomes
    the verb. The rest of the words, if any, become the object phrase. Examples:

    - [parse " feed   orange juice "] is [Feed \["orange"; "juice"\]]
    - [parse "quit"] is [Quit].

    Requires: [str] contains only alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and space
    characters (only ASCII character code 32; not tabs or newlines, etc.).

    Raises: [Empty] if [str] is the empty string or contains only spaces.

    Raises: [Malformed] if the command is malformed. A command is malformed if
    the verb is neither "quit" nor "go", or if the verb is "quit" and there is a
    non-empty object phrase, or if the verb is "go" and there is an empty object
    phrase.*)
