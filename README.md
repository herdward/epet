This is a project that I have worked on with 2 other people, 
for the class "CS 3110" at Cornell University, 
a functional programming and data structures course
that uses OCaml as the language of instruction.

What is seen here in this branch "1" is the state of the project at 
the time of submission of our last milestone
(MS3). 

Our handout had this at the top:
Finishing Your Project
Continue your one-week sprints. Build out more and more functionality. Check-in with your PM each week. All too soon the end of the semester will arrive. Rarely are any software projects truly complete. Rather, the ship date arrives, and we release the best software we can.

Remember that there is no specific functionality you are required to achieve, but that at your MS3 demo you are expected to deliver some functionality that offers clear value to users. It must also be new functionality that was not part of your MS2 demo.


Indeed, there is alot more functionality that could be added. I do plan to continue working on this project on my own free time, 
as more practice with my OCaml skills.
